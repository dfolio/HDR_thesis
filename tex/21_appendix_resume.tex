\section{Teaching Activities}\label{sec:CV:teaching}

\subsection{Teaching}

My overall teaching activities  have been solely related with the 61\up{st} CNU section which regroups scientific disciplines from control, computer engineering and signal processing.
I taught these teaching as a temporary teacher (\SI{3}{\years}), teaching assistant (ATER, \SI{1}{\year}), and then as associate professor (\SI{10}{\years}).
These different experiences are presented in the following.

\subsubsection{Before tenure}
I have started teaching as a temporary teacher at the Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse, France, during my doctorate (2004-2006).
Next, I have pursued as teaching assistant, specifically  in French \EFrench{Attaché Temporaire d'Enseignement et de Recherche} (ATER, 2007) for  the Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse.
My teachings were then mainly in the fields of robotics, control theory, image processing and real-time systems for students from bachelor's to master's degrees.
These global teaching experiences have led to a total volume of \SI{308}{\hETD}\footnote{\label{foot:CV:hETD}\glsreset{HETD}\glsdesc[hyper=false]{HETD}}.

These activities were my first experience in high-graduate education.
Those opportunities  highlighted my interest in the scientifics knowledge transmission. 
They also allowed me to be familiarized with the different forms of teachings.
Indeed, I had then the opportunity to supervise not only tutorials (TD), practical work (TP), and long-term projects  (BE); but also few courses.
Especially, I also helped the teaching team by writing some TP contents, and  in the students evaluation.
This first experience confirmed my interest in teaching, leading me logically to apply for an associate professor position.

\subsubsection{Since tenured}
\glsreset{INSA}
I was recruited as Associate Professor  in September 2008 for the 61\up{st} CNU section.
Untill now, my teaching activities have been mainly held at  \INSA \CVL on the Bourges campus.
The \INSA \CVL was established in 2014 following the merger of the Val de Loire ENI (National Engineering School) and Bourges ENSI (Graduate Engineering School).
With 200 members of staff (teachers, research professors, administrative and technical staff) the Institute trains 1500 students on its two campuses in Blois and Bourges, France. 
The Institute awards four engineering degrees:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Industrial Risk Control (MRI) in Bourges;
  \item Information Technology and Cybersecurity (STI)   in Bourges; 
  \item Energy, Risk and the Environment (ERE) together with the Cher Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) Hubert Curien CFSA (Apprentice Further Training Centre) in Bourges;
  \item Industrial Systems Engineering (GSI) in Blois
\end{enumerate}
The Institute was extended in 2015 when it absorbed the National Graduate School for Nature and Landscape, which has now become the "School for Nature and Landscape" department. 
Like all of the \INSA engineering schools, the first two years, that are common to each engineering degrees, is embedded in the Sciences and Techniques for Engineers (STPI) department.
It can been noticed, that the ERE department trains engineers through apprenticeship training
This program is  based on a partnership between the \INSA \CVL and Hubert Curien CFSA (Apprentice Further Training Centre), which has been an expert in delivering apprenticeship-based training for over 20 years.


\SkipAndBreak[1.5]

As member of the teaching team on the campus in Bourges of \INSA \CVL, I am mainly involved in the students formation of the Industrial Risk Control (MRI), of the  Energy, Risk and the Environment (ERE), and of the  Sciences and Techniques for Engineers (STPI) departments. 
Specifically, after having started with teaching of  electronics and electrical engineering, I have participated or organized lessons on  signal processing, sensors, control and robotics.
%
These various teaching experiences imply very different pedagogical tasks.
Especially, those tasks are depending on the type of intervention: courses (C), tutorials (TD), practical works (TP), tutored projects (P), long-term project team work (BE); but also according to the different degrees of scientific maturity and specialization of the concerned students, \ie  from bachelor's to master's degrees level.
\autoref{tab:teaching} illustrates a synthetic overview of my different teaching discipline showing the degree, the number of students, and the face-time hours.
In particular, I am especially involved in the implementation of the teachings materials, and to support the teaching assistants for the disciplines for which I am in charge.

  \label{fig:teaching_charge}
\end{figure}

\medskip

Since tenured as associate professor, my average teaching load is about \SI{280}{\hETD}.
This activity load is varied depending on the recruitment and the choice of engineering students in the different departments in which I intervene. 
In particular, the hours performed in tutorials (TD), practical works (TP) or  projects (P) depend on the number of groups (\ie from 2 to 4 groups), especially for the   bachelor's degrees (L1-L3).
\autoref{fig:teaching_charge} presents my teaching duty timeline progress expressed in \si{\hETD}  since tenured as Associate Professor.

Furthermore, some key events in the life of the Institute have also influenced my teaching loads (see also \autoref{fig:timeline}).
For instance, from 2011, following the integration of the former Bourges \ENSI  in the \INSA group,   I took part in the electronics training for the new preparatory cycle.
In parallel, since 2011, after the ERE department creation,  I have also started to form the apprentices engineers to electrical engineering.
In addition, various responsibilities entrusted to me have also influenced my teaching duties, and are presented hereafter. 

\subsection{Responsibilities}

%Plusieurs "obligations de services" sont liées à la fonction de maître de conférences : la participation aux jurys d

In addition to teaching tasks, different  obligations are related to the mission of teaching-researchers in France.
Thus, I am involved in the life of the Institute. 
Especially, I contribute at a local level to the scientific animations (eg., organization of laboratory visits), transfer and training-research links. 
Furthermore, since my tenure, I participate in the juries of our engineering students.
Similarly, since our establishment have joint the \INSA group, I also contribute to select and interview the applying students (about 15 students/year).
Between 2009 and 2013, I have been member of the Hygiene and Security committee of the \ENSI of Bourges.

Since September 2014, I am in charge of the Nuclear Energy option of the 5\up{th} year (engineer's degree) of the Industrial Risk Control (MRI) department. 
As such, I coordinate the specific lessons of the option by selecting and recruiting external professional contractors. 
I also organize visits (power station, simulator, etc.) for the engineering students of the option.
 
In March 2017, the direction of the \INSA \CVL  given to me the mission of referent \enquote{racism and antisemitism}.
Since November 2017, I am an elected member of the ERE  department council.

\subsection{Scientific Collaborations}\label{sec:CV:coll}

My research work have led to various international and national collaborations.
These cooperations have made possible to investigate complementary approaches to those I have studied, helping to benefit from supplementary skills.
These exchange were interesting and important in view of the strong multi-disciplinarity of the achieved works, the many physical principles used, the many technologies involved or of the scientific scope.
Hereafter  are listed scientific cooperative works that have led to publications.
