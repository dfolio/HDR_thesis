  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a two-dimensional autonomous navigation strategy of a 750 μm steel microrobot along
 complex fluidic vascular network inside the bore of a clinical 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. To ensure successful magnetic resonance navigation (MRN) of a microrobot along consecutive channels, the design of autonoumous navigation strategy is needed taking into account the major
MRI technological constraints and physiological perturbations, e.g. non-negligible pulsatile flow, limitations on the magnetic gradient amplitude, MRI overheating, susceptibility artifacts uncertainties, and so on. An optimal navigation planning framework based on Pareto optimality is proposed in order to deal with this multiple-objective problem. Based on these optimal conditions, a dedicated control architecture has been implemented in an interventional medical platform for real-time propulsion, control and imaging experiments. The reported experiments suggest that the likelihood of controlling autonomously untethered 750 μm magnetic microrobots is rendered possible in a complex two-dimensional centimeter-sized vascular phantom. The magnetic microrobot traveled intricate paths at a mean velocity of about 4 mm/s with average tracking errors below 800 μm with limited magnetic gradients ±15 mT/m compatible with clinical MRI scanners. The experiments demonstrate that it is effectively possible to autonomously guide a magnetic microrobot using a conventional MRI scanner with only a software upgrade},

Especially, unlike common approaches used with microscope where orthographic projection model were used, we have proposed to consider the weak-perspective model. Thus, the proposed vision-based force characterization allows us to retrieve the 3D translational velocities and accelerations of the magnetic microrobot viewed from a digital microscope.

The concept was studied for the future development of microrobots designed to perform minimally invasive interventions in remote sites accessible through the human cardiovascular system. A system software architecture is presented illustrating the different software modules to allow three-dimensional (3-D) navigation of a microdevice in blood vessels, namely: (i) vessel path extraction, (ii) magnetic gradient steering, (iii) tracking and (iv) closed-loop navigation control. First, the navigation path of the microrobot into the blood vessel is extracted using the Fast Marching Method from the pre-operation images (3-D {MRI} imaging) to guide the microrobot from the injection point to the tumor area through the anarchic vessel network.

First, the navigation path of the microrobot into the blood vessel is extracted using Fast Marching Method (FMM) from the pre-operation images (3D {MRI} imaging) to guide the microrobot from the injection point to the tumor area through the anarchic vessel network.

First, the controlled magnetic forces exerted on the magnetic microrobot was calibrated, validating the magnetic model. Secondly, the external forces were characterized on-line from digital microscope measurements. Especially, unlike common approaches used with microscope where orthographic projection model were used, we have proposed to consider the weak-perspective model. Thus, the proposed vision-based force characterization allows us to retrieve the 3D translational velocities and accelerations of the magnetic microrobot viewed from a digital microscope. Experimental results in two different environments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method},

The main difficulty is to control a group of different therapeutic microrobots at desired states, despite the presence of interaction forces between microrobots. To overcome this issue, the solution is to consider two rather spaced microrobots which are controlled along the x-axis using magnetic gradients and an oscillatory magnetic field. This magnetic interaction force is expressed based on a dipole dipole interaction model and dynamic modeling of two magnetic microrobots. The oscillatory magnetic field is used to overcome the surface forces between microrobots and microfluidic walls. Finally, an experimental investigation is carried out in a simple channel under the presence of the magnetic field and magnetic gradient forces in order to analyze the motion control of two magnetic microrobots using the combination of magnetic gradient and oscillatory magnetic fields. Also, we will assess the prevalence of the magnetic interaction forces between two microrobots.},

By nanorobotic manipulation, it is meant that nano-objects are localized, positioned, and placed by controlling external forces with sensorial feedback. The actual dual tele-nanomanipulation system is shown in Figure 1. Each atomic force microscope (AFM) probe is able to scan the surface in order to localize precisely the object before its manipulation but also to measure the nature and the intensity of the interaction between the tip and the object in order to tune the grabbing force to avoid sample damage. The force control is based on the measurement of the AFM cantilever due to the tip-surface interaction. In this presentation, we study the robust control issues of the dual AFM micro/nano manipulators motions to ensure tracking of the X-ray (or laser- ray) with micro/nanometric resolution. Robust control strategies for piezoelectric-stack actuated nanomanipulators are implemented to deal with uncertainties (modeling errors, sensor limitations...) and environment noise. Then, efficient robust algorithms are proposed to track the handling position variations due to beam exposition (electrostatic forces, Brownian motion, scattering...) based on Kalman filtering and particle filtering}},

These nanowires are fabricated using our previously developed electrodeposition-based technique, and their catalytic locomotion in the presence of H2O2 is investigated. Unlike conventional bimetallic nanowires that are self-electroosmotically propelled, our Au/Ru core-shell nanowires show both a noticeable decrease in rotational diffusivity and increase in motor speed with nanowire length. Numerical modelling based on self-electroosmosis attributes the decreases in rotational diffusivity to the formation of toroidal vortices at the nanowire tail, but fails to explain the speed increase with length. To reconcile this inconsistency, we propose a combined mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis and electroosmosis based on the oxygen gradient produced by catalytic shells. This mechanism successfully explains not only the peculiar speed increase of Au/Ru core-shell nanomotors with length, but also the large variation in speeds among Au/Ru, Au/Rh and Rh/Au core-shell nanomotors. The possible contribution of diffusiophoresis to an otherwise well-established electroosmotic mechanism sheds light on future designs of nanomotors, at the same time highlighting the complex nature of nanoscale propulsion.},

The approach is to consider the sensor/robot interaction that links the sensor signal variations to the robot velocity. By on-line calibration, we mean only the actual measurements are used to perform calibration under the condition that the interaction matrix is analytically known. This allows us to propose a very simple and versatile formulation of sensor parameter calibration. Various sensors can be considered, and calibration from different sensory data may be considered within the same process. Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters estimation are formulated as a non-linear minimization problem the Jacobian of which can be expressed analytically from the sensor model. Simulations and experiments are presented for a camera observing four points, showing good results in the case of separated intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, and illustrating the possible limitations in the caseof simultaneous estimation},

  Abstract                 = {Microinjection is the highly efficient delivery method of exogenous materials into cells, and it has been widely used in biomedical research areas such as transgenics and genomics. However, this direct injection task is time consuming and laborious, resulting in low throughput and poor reproducibility. This paper describes a telerobotic shared control (TSC) framework for the microinjection with high manipulation efficiencies, in which a micromanipulator is controlled by the shared motion commands of both the human operator (direct manipulation) and the autonomous controller. To determine the optimal gains between the operator and the controller, we proposed a quantitative evaluation method using Fitts' and steering laws. The results showed that a 40%-60% weighting on the human operator produced better performance for both speed and accuracy of task completion, and suggested that some level of automation or human involvement is important for microinjection tasks},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a robotized tele-echography system with an assisting visibility mode that helps the medical expert diagnosis. This autonomous mode is based on a multitask control approach that maintains the visibility of an anatomic element of interest while the medical expert tele-operates a 2D ultrasound probe held by a 4-DoF robot. The main task is used to automatically maintain several visual constraints that guarantee an intersection between the US image plane and the organ of interest. A secondary task allows the medical expert to manually apply the probe motion through the tele-operation mode. The main advantage of this approach is to give to the clinician the control of all the degrees of freedom of the probe to examine the patient while automatically preserving the visibility of the organ of interest when required. Experimental results, performed on a phantom and human abdomen, demonstrate the efficiency of the visibility assistance task},
